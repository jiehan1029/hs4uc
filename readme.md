### What is it??
This project is done during the Thanksgiving holiday when I started to study local high schools for the kid. As the name suggests, HS4UC (high school for UC), I'm trying to compare the local school's admission rate to certain UC campuses in recent years. Nature of the project is therefore very personal, aiming to have something done fast, and analysis may not be that accurate, and I don't plan to expand it (holiday is ending). There is also an frontend app for its visualization (HS4UC-vis).


### Data source
